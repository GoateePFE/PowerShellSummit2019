# PowerShell Summit 2019
Materials for the *Hands on lab: Hunting PowerShell Badness*.

This lab was done on site at the event with an environment hosted online.
That environment was decommissioned after the event.

To do this at home ignore the credentials and machine names in the lab guides.
Instead build your own environment and accounts using the outline in Lab_99_Home_Lab_Build.md found in this repo.
Then substitute your own machine names and credentials in the appropriate lab steps.
